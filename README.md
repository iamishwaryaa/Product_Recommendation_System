# Product_Recommendation_System
Product-recommendation system is powered by machine learning and employs suggestions of goods to users associated with a brand's digital assets. Driven by a range of algorithmic decisions, recommendations algorithms have a customized experience for user, product and background information. 

**The recommendation system is designed in 3 parts based on the business context:**

**Recommendation system part I:** Product popularity based system targeted at new customers

**Recommendation system part II:** Model-based collaborative filtering system based on customer's purchase history and ratings provided by other users who bought items similar items

**Recommendation system part III:** When a business is setting up its e-commerce website for the first time without any product rating
